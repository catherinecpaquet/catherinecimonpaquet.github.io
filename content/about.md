Hi! My name is Catherine and I am a PhD candidate in Educational Psychology at the Université du Québec à Montréal, located in beautiful Québec, Canada. I previously completed a CEGEP degree in health sciences, a Bachelor's degree (BSc) and a Masters degree (MSc) in Developmental Psychology at Université de Montréal, Canada.

With over 9 years of experience in scientific research, I am interested in advanced statistical analysis (R, Mplus), as I aim to better understand the complexity of human psychology.

I have published [10+ scientific papers](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5-tHWakAAAAJ&hl=en) and did 50+ presentations at conferences in Canada, the United States and Europe. I have won several awards in national competitions (Québec Research Funds, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) and I have the opportunity to do international research visits as part of my work.

My research interests are in the area of human development (interpersonal relationships, motivation, passion, sleep, and educational pathways). I am passionate about parenting and how our early experiences have profound impacts on our future relationships and our well-being.

During my career, I have coordinated research projects and participated in the training of numerous university students (mentoring, coaching, teaching). I am highly involved in science communication (blog posts, podcasts, videos) and created a community of 6000+ people on my various social networks.

Finally, I contribute regularly to nonprofit organizations, notably the Canadian Positive Psychology Association and Science & Policy Exchange.

My top character strengths are honesty, love of learning, perseverance, courage and perspective!

I am a collaborator on several science communication projects:
