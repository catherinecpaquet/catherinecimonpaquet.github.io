Hi! My name is Catherine and I am a PhD candidate in Educational Psychology at the Université du Québec à Montréal, located in beautiful Québec, Canada. I previously completed a CEGEP degree in health sciences, a Bachelor's degree (BSc) and a Masters degree (MSc) in Developmental Psychology at Université de Montréal, Canada.

With over 9 years of experience in scientific research, I am interested in advanced statistical analysis (R, Mplus), as I aim to better understand the complexity of human psychology.

I have published [10+ scientific papers](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5-tHWakAAAAJ&hl=en) and did 50+ presentations at conferences in Canada, the United States and Europe. I have the opportunity to do international research visits as part of my work.

I am currently funded by a Canada Graduate Scholarship - Doctoral program (CGS-D Joseph-Armand Bombardier 2021-2024) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). I previously secured funding from the Québec Research Funds, SSHRC, UQAM, Université de Montréal, Centre for Research on Human Development, Society for Research on Child Development, and the Society for Research on Adolescence. I have no conflicts of interests to declare.

My research interests are in the area of human development and positive psychology (interpersonal relationships, motivation, passion, sleep, and educational pathways). I am passionate about parenting and how our early experiences have profound impacts on our future relationships and our well-being.

During my career, I have coordinated research projects and participated in the training of numerous university students (mentoring, coaching, teaching). I am highly involved in [science communication (blog posts, podcasts, videos)](https://www.catherinecimonpaquet.com/medias) and created a community of 6000+ people on my various social networks.

Finally, I volunteer regularly for nonprofit organizations, notably the [Canadian Positive Psychology Association](https://cppa.ca/student-zone/) and [Science & Policy Exchange](https://sp-exchange.ca/). I am highly involved in promoting the importance of including women in STEM and also to reduce racism and all inequities in academia. We could all benefit from more inclusivity, diversity, and respect in academia.

My top character strengths are honesty, love of learning, perseverance, courage and perspective!

I try to embody what I study, and thus, I try to align my actions with my core values. In my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, with the people I love most, and I practice yoga and mindfulness.

I am a collaborator on several science communication projects:
